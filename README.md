IPL Data Analysis
This repository contains a simplified version of the IPL (Indian Premier League) dataset, which includes key match and player statistics. The data can be used for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizing insights related to team performance, match outcomes, and player achievements.

Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following columns:

match_id: Unique identifier for each match.
season: The IPL season in which the match took place.
team1: The first team playing in the match.
team2: The second team playing in the match.
winner: The winning team of the match.
player_of_the_match: Player awarded the 'Player of the Match'.
runs: Total runs scored by a team.
wickets: Total wickets taken by a team.
extras: Extras scored by a team (e.g., wide balls, no balls).
venue: The venue where the match was played.
match_date: Date when the match was played.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The analysis steps include:

Initial Overview: Using head() and info() to explore the dataset structure.
Win Frequency: Analyzing the frequency of wins by each team and the distribution of 'Player of the Match' awards.
Statistical Calculations: Calculating the average runs, wickets, and extras scored per match.
Data Visualization
Several visualizations are created to better understand the data:

Wins by Team: A bar plot showing the number of wins by each team using sns.countplot().
Runs Distribution: A histogram visualizing the distribution of runs scored in matches using plt.hist().
Runs vs Wickets: A scatter plot to examine the relationship between runs scored and wickets taken.
Player of the Match: A bar plot visualizing the distribution of 'Player of the Match' awards.
Advanced Analysis
Win Percentage by Team: Calculating the win percentage of each team based on match outcomes.
Season-wise Performance: Analyzing the number of wins by each team per season using groupby and plotting season-wise statistics.
Venue-based Performance: Aggregating runs and wickets scored per venue to understand team performances at different locations.
